This generateFunction() code block defines a function called generatePlaylist 
that takes two parameters: an array of songs (array) and an 
object representing the preferences of different 
guardians (preferences). The function returns an object where
each key 
corresponds to a guardian's name, and the value is an 
array of songs filtered based on that guardian's 
preferred genre.


How reduce() works:

arr.reduce(callback[, initialValue])

The callback method takes: 

acc: the value is remembered throughout each iteration of 
    the method and ultimately becomes the final returned value

AND 

currentValue: the current element being processed in the array

if we want to convert the following array: 
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'] into an object we say:

const obj = letters.reduce(accumulator, currentValue) => {
  accumulator[currentValue] = currentValue;
  return accumulator;
}, {});

console.log(obj);
